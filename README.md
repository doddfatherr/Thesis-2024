This repository includes all data and scripts used during the work conducted for: 

**DEVELOPMENT OF A DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM USING
ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) AND ACCELERATION TO MONITOR
UPPER EXTREMITY BEHAVIOR WITH APPLICATION TO INDIVIDUALS
POST-STROKE**

*Presented by Nathan Dodd in fullfillment of Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo*

This work is broken into two distinct contributions. Contribution 1 attempts to develop a relationship between electromyography (EMG) and grip aperture, or the distance measured between thumb and forefinger. We developed a computer vision application to measure grip aperture. Contribution 2 struves to develop a neural network capable of classyfying human activity from long-term, in-home continuous EMG and acceleration data. We built a long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of correctly classifying human activity with an accuracy of 94% and an F1 score of 84%.
